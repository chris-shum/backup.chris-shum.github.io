description: The Boop List was my first project at General Assembly; I created a checklist app. In order to keep things simple for the user, I made every function (adding, deleting, saving) controllable with one button. The app consists of two activities; each activity includes of an EditText view and a button which allows the user to add items onto an ArrayList. The ArrayList is then displayed using a ListView using a SimpleAdapter. I also used a hashmap to index the multiple ArrayLists created by the user. The UI also includes of using OnItemClickListeners to pass data through an intent with startActivityForResult().
