description: SoulJerz is a New Jersey based BBoy/BGirl crew whose aim is to spread love and the knowledge of the hip-hop culture around the globe. As a member of SoulJerz Dance Entertainment, I spend my time promoting the crew's message with my talents. From performing alongside my fellow crew mates, to teaching dance to the local community, to organizing events for said community.
